Improper waste management is a critical environmental issue worldwide. Rapid urbanization, population growth, and consumer-driven lifestyles have led to a significant increase in waste generation, resulting in pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and inefficient recycling processes. A major challenge in addressing this issue is the lack of efficient, automated systems for waste segregation, which currently relies heavily on manual sorting. Manual processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and often impractical at scale.

The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)–based image classification system capable of automatically identifying and classifying waste into categories such as organic, recyclable, and non-recyclable. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this system aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of waste sorting, enabling smarter recycling processes and contributing to environmental sustainability.

An automated waste classification system can significantly reduce human effort, accelerate recycling workflows, and promote responsible waste management practices, ultimately contributing to cleaner cities, reduced environmental pollution, and a more sustainable future.
