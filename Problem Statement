# Project Title
Automated Waste Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Problem Statement
Improper waste management is a major environmental challenge, leading to pollution and inefficient recycling. Many times, waste is not segregated properly at the source, making disposal and recycling harder.

This project aims to develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model that can automatically classify waste images into **organic, recyclable, and non-recyclable categories**. The system will assist in **automated waste segregation**, reduce human effort, and promote **environmental sustainability**.

## Objectives
- Build a CNN model to classify different types of waste.  
- Improve recycling efficiency through automated recognition.  
- Support sustainable waste management practices.
